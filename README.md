# Max Avoid
Max avoid is a game developed with PhaserJs.

This was developed separating the logic in entities, components and systems.

*Entities:* Objects of the game built with the components using composition pattern.

*Components:* Add functionality to the entities.

*Systems:* Mediators between the entities. They know how the entities should interact.

The code documentation is partially translated from spanish to english. I will try to complete the translation on my free time.
